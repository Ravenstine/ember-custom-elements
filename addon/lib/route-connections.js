/**
 * This file is a bit of a hack.  What it does is expose access to a
 * private value in the Ember internals which allows us to consistently
 * map route instances to outlet states.  Otherwise, there isn't a way
 * to identify whether an outlet state matches a route other than
 * matching by template name, which may be totally different from the
 * route name if the route is rendering different templates into
 * named routes.
 * 
 * Fortunately, the internal module for Ember.Route exports its WeakMap
 * for keeping track of what routes are connected to which outlet states.
